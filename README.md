# ImageMining
Used Amazon Rekognition API to build an image vector to detect, analyze, and index faces. Combined the capabilities of Amazon Rekognition
with other AWS services like Amazon Dynamo DB, Lambda, and S3 bucket to provide highly accurate facial analysis. I used Python code to build
a strategy to find a match for only the most prominent face (or largest) within an image and call for API which triggers the Lambda function.
